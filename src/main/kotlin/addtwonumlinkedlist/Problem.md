# Problem Statement

> You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

`Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/`

## Sample Input 1

list1 = `[2, 4, 3]`

list2 = `[5, 6, 4]`

## Sample Output

`[7, 0, 8]`

### Explaination

`342` + `465` = `807`

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
